I stumbled upon a book titled `Just Give It a Try? UX` at the library and decided to read it. It was thin and I finished it quickly, leaving some notes on certain parts. [Link to the book for sale](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001078504)

# Impressions

As a front-end developer, I have always had some interest in UX. Even when creating this blog, I often thought about how users could find the desired page with less interaction.

Having read some UX-related articles in that process, I found some contents in this book familiar. However, there were two new insights that stood out to me.

First, simplicity in appearance is not always favorable. For instance, in some devices, the UI tries to simplify by having only one or two buttons, which for me resulted in a terrible user experience. There were many functions that needed to be included, but fitting them into just one or two buttons often required bizarre operations, like pressing one button and holding the second for an extended period.

This emphasizes that it is not about whether something looks simple or complex; rather, it is essential to include all necessary information while establishing a natural structure.

Second, UX must consider every moment the user experiences. The author discusses Apple's unboxing experience as an example. While unboxing is entirely unrelated to the main functions of an iPhone or MacBook, opening a well-packaged box, powering on the device for the first time, and seeing a welcome message creates a positive user experience with the brand.

Beyond brand image, the core functionality of the product is important, but the entire journey from the moment a user encounters the product to the point they might stop using it falls within the realm of UX. For instance, even picking up a smartphone is part of the UX.

These were the new insights I gained about UX from the book, and now I will note down some excerpts from the book.

## Pages 21-22

At the time, the greatest help for quickly learning and adapting to practical work was reading the documentation of previous projects in detail. Specifically, I closely examined the documents that organized project schedules. Every project typically has a schedule document, which contains more information than expected. It summarizes all departments involved and the tasks each department must complete, along with their deadlines.

Through this, I could understand which departments were engaged in the project and what each department broadly handled. I was also able to compare the duration of tasks by department. Additionally, since the document sequentially lists tasks to check and confirm throughout the project, I could grasp the overall process of how work progresses.

Another method was to review various UI scenarios from the projects. While examining the aforementioned schedule management documents was a form of self-directed learning, reviewing scenarios felt like cramming for an exam with no prior knowledge just days away. I desperately looked at as many scenarios as possible. Doing this frequently allowed me to learn the common format used for scenarios within the company, as well as how the overall structure and individual pieces of information were articulated. Over time, I could easily identify the main scenes and find areas where the logic did not align.

However, nowadays, with the trend moving towards a flat design style, the styling itself is not as critical as it once was. GUI designs have become quite similar, making it difficult to find differentiating factors. It seems that now is the time to focus more on functionality based on data or usability. It's more important than ever to design to effectively present information to users, encourage clicks, and lead to execution.

Additionally, users perceive the brand's image through every moment they directly interact with the product or service. This is true for both online and offline experiences. Such moments are referred to as Moments of Truth, and the more positive experiences accumulated during these moments, the better the brandâ€™s image becomes. This means that a UX designer should consider not only the experience within the display but also every moment a user encounters the product or service. Particularly, as the world becomes interconnected through tight networks and IoT, this consideration has become even more critical. The boundaries between online and offline experiences are blurring, and what we refer to as user experience is becoming a part of daily patterns and methods.

Analyzing moments when users engage with products and services helps identify potential problems and areas of opportunity. The most challenging yet important aspect is to provide a UX where the same brand voice can be felt through these problems or opportunities at every moment.

- How should we design experiences that evoke a sense of brand from a UX perspective? How can we integrate brand identity into user experience?

The most important step seems to be identifying the company's essence and continuously simplifying it. Rather than elaborately explaining the company with all sorts of embellishments, it should be definable in one word. For example, words like playfulness come to mind for Google, and elitist for Apple. There should be a process of validating countless ideas around that word in all aspects of UX, including interaction, motion, and color. Questions like what color represents playfulness or how interactions should be designed must be considered. Through this thought process, I believe it is possible to create a unique and appropriate experience for the company.

Every ordinary and familiar element contains hints and clues we desire. Therefore, a UX designer should always practice observing and scrutinizing. Particularly, if something feels uncomfortable, it should never be overlooked. If a UX designer feels discomfort, it is likely that others experience similar feelings.

One should not dismiss discomfort but rather foster a habit of contemplating why it is uncomfortable and how it can be improved.

In this way, intuitive UX begins with feelings and thoughts derived from familiarity. This is the best way to gather ideas for intuitive UX. Moreover, the intuitiveness that arises from familiarity must be natural. This means it should be both familiar and subtle, occurring naturally and without effort. If clarity is needed, it may be better to provide detailed instructions rather than rely on intuitive methods.

In UX, the issue of simplicity versus complexity can be assessed based on whether users feel confusion with the provided structure. One cannot simply categorize simplicity and complexity as good or bad in themselves.

The world is becoming increasingly complex. Numerous functions are required, there's much to say, and lots to showcase. In this situation, people may gravitate towards what appears to be simpler. However, visible simplicity and the simplicity of use are different. There still exists both the beauty and necessity of complexity. Let us not confuse these differences. Should dilemmas arise in UX concerning complexity and simplicity, it is essential to remember to prioritize clarity and conciseness to mitigate confusion stemming from structure.

Paul: Naturally, we must consider natural connectivity. An essential point is that metaphors must align. The metaphor a user hears must correspond with what they see. For instance, all devices associated with Apple should consistently convey the image of being red and edible. This part must be contextually understood so that the metaphors are comprehensible and consistently delivered through visual and auditory experiences. Ultimately, technology must underpin this.

Daniel: When speaking of seamless experiences between displays, I believe it is important to ensure consistent communication. Thus, the overall tone and manner must align. This means that the tone and manner conveyed through all senses, including visual and auditory, should be unified to ensure that boundaries between devices are indistinguishable.

As a UX designer, I am always working for 'people.' The fundamental purpose of UX, which remains unchanged now and in the future, is to provide convenient usability and facilitate smooth communication between people or between people and machines. I have consistently endeavored to understand people well and consider what matters most, what the goals are, and what should be prioritized. Today, I am excited to be at the forefront of realizing the imaginative future for people. This is why I take pride in being a UX designer.
